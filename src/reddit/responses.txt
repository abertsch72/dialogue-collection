I guess my brother. My parents hurt, but it was different. My brother promised he’d never leave - my parents never cared.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r6a1s0/tw_my_whole_family_killed_themselves_ama/hms01kb/)\nSo sorry to hear that. Who raised you? Were you living together at the time?|Thank you, we were living together. We were raised by my Grandma until my brother turned 18, then we lived on our own. When my brother died I went to live with my Grandma again, I moved out at 18|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r6a1s0/tw_my_whole_family_killed_themselves_ama/hmrwijn/)\nI'm so sorry for you. I wish you the best.|Right back at you. <3|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r6a1s0/tw_my_whole_family_killed_themselves_ama/hms76zt/)\nDid they leave notes explaining why they did it?  Were there any signs that they would do it or did they hid it well?  Are you ok?|Nobody left anything except for my Dad. He left a bunch of texts on my Mum’s phone - I only found out about them last year when I moved out and I found them in the coroner’s report. All blaming me and my brother.  Signs - I’m not sure. Almost everything can be a sign if you look at it in a certain way. I was too young to notice signs in my parents, but my brother was extra warm to me in the last weeks. We hung out a lot, we went on a roadtrip together. I thought he was just becoming happier… more excited for life. He was just graduating University. I guess now it’s more obvious that he was just saying goodbye.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r6a1s0/tw_my_whole_family_killed_themselves_ama/hms6haz/)\nFirstly, I want to convey my condolences. Truly. My heart hurts for you.  I just lost my daughter to suicide this past January. She was 34. Our lives will never be the same.  Please continue talking about your losses. Keep opening up and keep that heart of yours open, too. It’s a good one and it’s worth all that life has to offer. Remember that.  Their suicides were not about you.  Sending you so much love and light.|I’m so sorry. I’ve been surrounded by death my whole life, but I can’t imagine what it’s like to lose a child. Thank you so much for sharing with me. I know we’ll be okay. ❤️|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r6a1s0/tw_my_whole_family_killed_themselves_ama/hmsjzf8/)\nI am hopeful you have a long, prosperous, and fulfilling life filled with peace and surrounded by love.|I appreciate it. I really do. <3|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r6a1s0/tw_my_whole_family_killed_themselves_ama/hmsfta1/)\nCan I give you a hug?|⊂(・﹏・⊂)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r6a1s0/tw_my_whole_family_killed_themselves_ama/hmshfj8/)\nHow are you doing now ?|I’m okay. The most important thing is to stay grounded. I think when you’re surrounded by tragedy it feels inevitable that you’ll end up the same way. Life isn’t like that.  Taking it day by day|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r6a1s0/tw_my_whole_family_killed_themselves_ama/hms14kv/)\nSorry if this is too much but coming from someone who has attempted multiple times, how do you keep yourself from hurting yourself in that situation? Maybe it’s my mental illness(es) speaking but I feel like if I was in that situation I might’ve been even more susceptible to it. Proud of you.|Not too much at all.  First of all, this isn’t real advice. This is just from my own experience, and what I’ve done. I’ve attempted too, and I’ve struggled (still do) with self harm.  This is a bit obvious: If you’re not already seeing a therapist - do it. If it doesn’t work, try a different one. It sucks. It really does. It is so hard to have to open up to someone only to realise that they’re not the right fit for you. But you can’t give up. There are some things that friends just aren’t equipped to help with. There’s a reason these people have to study for ages to be able to help.  One of the most important things for me is to stay grounded. Remember that nothing is set in stone. Just because my family chose that path, that doesn’t mean I’m doomed to do the same.  Also, I procrastinate. Seriously. When I’ve felt like choosing that path, I’ve tried to just think: Eh. Maybe I’ll see if it gets better and if not then I’ll do it next year. I’ve been repeating that every year for as long as I can remember!  And humour. Humour saved me. It’s so much easier to accept your situation when you can joke about it.  Yeah, it sucks, but at least I got some attention on Reddit for it 🤷\u200d♀️  I know you’ve heard it before at it probably makes your eyes roll, but suicide isn’t the answer. It shouldn’t even be an option. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from my life, it’s that I never want to make anyone feel the way I do when I think about my family.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r6a1s0/tw_my_whole_family_killed_themselves_ama/hmsl8pf/)\nMy deepest condolences. Out of all the ways to have people around you die, suicide is the worst. I wish you happier days going forward|Thank you, I really do appreciate it. I’ll be okay.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r6a1s0/tw_my_whole_family_killed_themselves_ama/hmsn2ae/)\nWhy|Big question!  I don’t know. My Dad was always unstable. He and my Mum had a very rough relationship - I remember one time my Mum took us away for a bit and he stalked us. He threatened to shoot himself if we didn’t come home.  I think my Mum just couldn’t take it.  I don’t know why my brother left. I never will.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r6a1s0/tw_my_whole_family_killed_themselves_ama/hmsdsah/)\nHow old was your brother?|A month from turning 22|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r6a1s0/tw_my_whole_family_killed_themselves_ama/hmrweyt/)\nHow old are you now? How are you doing in life?|I’m 19 now - I’m doing okay. I live by myself and I have a full time job in Marketing. I’m also in University. I have two close friends that I love and that love me.

Additionally, I’m a pleaser, so if the other person is enjoying themselves, then that gives me arousal too.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r65pv3/i_am_a_male_sex_worker_ama/hmr714y/)\nDo friends or family in real life know what you do for work and are they generally accepting of it?|They do yes and generally are accepting. It was rough at first though as I’m sure you can imagine.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r65pv3/i_am_a_male_sex_worker_ama/hmr7t2y/)\nhow do you get clients|Online ads mostly. And also some word of mouth, not as common though.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r65pv3/i_am_a_male_sex_worker_ama/hmr7spo/)\nIs there a stereotypical type of woman who hires you?  What percentage of them are married you think?  Do you have regulars?  Do you make good money?  Do you always use a condom?|Most of my clients are 30+  It’s hard to say really? Maybe at least 25%  I do have some regulars.  I have a good hourly rate, and I get enough appointments to help me live comfortably.  And yes I do. It’s way too hard to ensure the other person is clean of diseases or on birth control. I know a condom isn’t perfect protection but it’s more protection that not wearing one.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r65pv3/i_am_a_male_sex_worker_ama/hmr836b/)\nWeirdest request?|Oh anything to do with faeces is weird to me. But I also find cuckhold weird but not in a judgemental way. I’ve been asked to tie up a husband and make him watch me having sex with his wife. That was unusual for sure.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r65pv3/i_am_a_male_sex_worker_ama/hmr9lpc/)\nWhat does your job entail?|I am paid to have sex with my clients. It’s not always sex but it’s of that nature.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r65pv3/i_am_a_male_sex_worker_ama/hmr5wz1/)\nporn star? prostitute? OF?|Prostitute, but escort is what I prefer to call myself. Same thing though.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r65pv3/i_am_a_male_sex_worker_ama/hmr60z2/)\nAre you bi? Clients both male and female? What she typically?|I only see female clients. My own personal preference. It does have an impact on my quantity of clients.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r65pv3/i_am_a_male_sex_worker_ama/hmr6ad9/)\nI can’t cum more than once per day, so how did you manage to do it multiple times per day?|One thing that might sound silly is to be well hydrated. It helps me at least. Also i don’t tend to have heaps of appointments in one day. But I do try and space them out to give myself time to recover.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r65pv3/i_am_a_male_sex_worker_ama/hmr9iai/)\nHow do you please a woman?|The most important thing is to listen to what they like most. If you put a lot of attention into what they like then they’ll enjoy themselves and then if they’re a decent person, reciprocate that. Everyone is different, so understanding what’s important to the other person is the most general way of making sure they’re enjoying the experience. Also, whatever you do, add variety. Whether that be speed or rhythm or positions, it doesn’t matter. Variety adds excitement.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r65pv3/i_am_a_male_sex_worker_ama/hmrce5d/)\nHow did you first start?|I started out work online agencies. It’s the safest way of doing things and they sort out a lot of things for you that would be difficult to begin with.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r65pv3/i_am_a_male_sex_worker_ama/hmrci6z/)\nAre you an expert pussy eater?|Well I do it a lot and I don’t get complaints. That’s the cocky answer haha. But I do it often enough through my work and my personal sex life to know what I’m doing.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r65pv3/i_am_a_male_sex_worker_ama/hmrdzrh/)\nWhy did you become a sex worker?|I was in a difficult financial situation and out of home etc and needed money badly and it was just something I chose to do out of necessity. I’m all good now but I’ve grown to enjoy the job so I’m still doing it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r65pv3/i_am_a_male_sex_worker_ama/hmregi9/)\n\n---\n[Source] (https://github.com/johnsliao/ama_compiler)']], [['u21s19e5r18', 'I am a male sex worker… AMA!\nSo yeah the title is pretty self explanatory.

The "plap" sound also didn\'t match up with when the, I\'m assuming, male werewolf thrusted in. The sound was going faster.  Like I said I tried to focus on the sound on not to much the werewolf, but I eventually gave up and just started watching.

Import for a good realrionship is a good communication. You have to say If anything anoys you, because otherwise you have to suffer the next 30years from it. But more important is to tell him, what you love about him everyday.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r6gzmi/im_married_for_over_20_years_ama/hmt8drg/)\nHow's the sex life?|Good|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r6gzmi/im_married_for_over_20_years_ama/hmtmib1/)\nAny kids?

Writers have always intrigued me; I envy their ability to just sit and write.  But I also appreciate that there is much more to writing; that the writer has to envision a beginning and an end, and there has to be flow and character and plot development, and grammar and editing.  Congrats on your success.  With all of that said, I’ve got some random questions: \n\n1. Do you believe self publishing has led to a different financial outcome for you than publishing through a third party?  \n2. Are you able to make a living as a self published author?  \n3.  How much do you make per book?  \n4. How much time do you spend writing each book?\n5. Is writing your only source of income?\n6. Who does your editing?\n\nThank you.'], ['BindingsAuthor', "Glad to be able to speak my mind, and I hope my answers are helpful.  As a storyteller, my job is easy.  I just have to take a story that I feel wants to be told, and take care to deliver it in an interesting, compelling way.  But I feel like these days, especially for self-published writers, you have to wear a lot of other hats, or team up with the right people to get things done.  It's definitely a collaborative effort!\n\nAs to your questions...\n\nI have a feeling that if I was able to wrangle myself and write to market better, I would have been more successful as a traditionally published author, but I don't know how long I would have been able to keep that up.  The joy that I have is in telling a story that wants to be told, and the hope is that some day word of mouth will take my little pseudo-fantasy superheroes story in an even better direction.\n\nRight now, I would be living in poverty if I tried to live off these books.  Part of that is no doubt due to poor marketing on my side.  I get in my own way a lot, and even though I've got all these books out, I've made excuse after excuse not to market them.  I changed that late this year, and found some moderate success with my latest book, but it was more of an experiment than jumping into the deep end.  I'm wrapping up a trilogy next year, and I'll be pushing a little harder on that to see what works.\n\nWith that most recent book, it came out late in October, and I've sold 60 copies so far, and made something like $30.  Not a huge amount at all.  The books have been moderately to well-received, so I keep coming back to thinking it's all about getting it noticed, and I'm decidedly bad at that, but trying to get better.\n\nI take a long while to write, generally speaking, and I work on multiple projects at once.  I typically write between 1,000 and 2,000 words per day, and my books are about 150,000 words long on average these days.  If I focused on only one at a time, I'd probably be able to crank out a book every three months, but then editing and beta readers would mean that it would come out a while after that.\n\nI have a full time job which can suck up a lot of my time depending on the time of year and what projects we're working on.  I make a comfortable living with that.  I also make a bit of money on the side in promoting other people's work.  That usually helps to pay for editing and artwork.  I also make a bit every month on the audiobooks.\n\nI have two editors.  One has been with me from book one, and he's recently started to write his own novel set in the same universe which is coming along.  The second editor I brought in to help clean up any things that might have been missed along the way.  Finally, I have who I'll call a superfan (I don't know if she would consider herself that, but she's been super for me) from Greece who translated Lord of the Rings for that language, and she's been helping me to catch some of the other things, including on short stories that I don't edit until after they're ready to go into an anthology.\n\nHope I caught everything there!\n\n**Edit**: I wanted to mention, when I released the first book, it was right before the second book launched, and for a while, I was making around $600 on those two books alone each month.  I think that Reddit had a big part to play in it, and I've been chasing that high ever since."]], [['BindingsAuthor', "I am a writer who gave up on trying to publish the traditional way ten years ago.

I'm willing to bet that there wasn't a positive ROI, but I was also a little too nervous to jump in any farther just yet.  You're supposed to scale up, and I think since this latest book I released was a series starter, I talked myself out of doubling down.  With a trilogy ender coming early next year, I'm going to use that to really test things out and see if I can make a bigger splash.  My theory is that once you break into the top 100 in your categories, that's when it starts to make a difference, because the Amazon algorithm then kicks in and starts to tell more people about your book.  It compounds at that point, and that's when the ROI flips over to green.\n\nAgain, just a theory until I put it into practice."]], [['BindingsAuthor', "I am a writer who gave up on trying to publish the traditional way ten years ago.

That doesn't necessarily have to be money. It could mean getting your stories out into the world and hoping to have an effect on someone.\n\nIt could very well be money, and that's okay too.  But if it is money, prepare yourself for the mentality that most of the biggest money-makers need to be written to market—that could be up your alley, I just want you to set clear expectations for yourself.\n\nThe second thing is that even a fantastic book has a hard time moving the needle on its own.  Writing and publishing a book is a humongous accomplishment, and you deserve all the praise in the world for getting that far.  But keep writing.  Write a series.  Write a universe.  Just keep at it, and your books begin to promote each other.  My books are all set in the same world, but different sets focus on different characters.  I'll still get random folks who will buy the entire catalog once they test drive a few of them.\n\nInvest in yourself as a brand.  Your books will earn you readers.  You will earn yourself fans.  Get a website for yourself, and link it to a newsletter.  Your newsletter is the one thing that you have the utmost control of, and you weren't have to worry about Facebook or Amazon pulling the rug out from under you when they change interfaces or policies.\n\nKeep copious notes, especially if you're building a sprawling world.  Use tools like World Anvil to help catalog your content (plus, as a bonus you can make some awesome maps with interactive interfaces for your fans).\n\nThat's just some to start, but if you have any questions beyond that, you can ask them here or DM me.\n\nCheers!"]], [['BindingsAuthor', "I am a writer who gave up on trying to publish the traditional way ten years ago.

Any cool stories about life on the streets?|They\'re all dead. The last one alive is my uncle.  Dad died from falling and cracking his head open in a drunken stupor.  Mom died from COPD complications.  Sister recovered from an OD, then died from an infection.  Brother\'s in prison for life.  Etc.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r5v9la/i_ran_away_from_an_abusive_home_and_became/hmpcn95/)\nare you happy in life?|Not even close.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r5v9la/i_ran_away_from_an_abusive_home_and_became/hmpp86f/)\nWhat kept you going?|I met my first and only girlfriend at the time.

It would have been so easy to just give up, but you didn’t, that’s impressive. My question would be, what was your life like when you were homeless without an apartment?|I didn\'t go to shelters, because I had already convinced the McDonald\'s managers that I was 18 (or they just didn\'t care), there was no way I could convince any of the shelter managers that I was 18, because I\'m 22 and still have baby face to this day. They\'d figure out where I came from and turn me over to my dad, and he\'d probably kill me.  That\'s not an exaggeration, either. He threw me off of our home\'s roof at 6, and I had to be revived in hospital. I don\'t remember the exact story he told, but it went something like "I left a ladder to our roof because I was doing gutter cleaning, he climbed up there and went baba booey"  To answer your question, though, I slept in ditches, or under bridges. Even though I was an extremely young homeless person, the homeless never gave a fuck about me. That was something I had to learn early on. Even so, I would sneak a few McChickens out of the McDonald\'s I worked at, and handed them out to the homeless nearby when I could. They were grateful, but there was nothing *they* could do for me. I don\'t resent them for it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r5v9la/i_ran_away_from_an_abusive_home_and_became/hmqo9na/)\nFrom one person on the internet to another, congrats on making it this far through your journey.|Thanks Paul.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r5v9la/i_ran_away_from_an_abusive_home_and_became/hmq833m/)\nThis is character, here’s the thing tho. Pain is required for rapid growth. I’m sorry you went thru abuse, but you’re a rare, and strong human. Nothing I love and respect more than someone who picked themselves up from the hellfire that is parental or spousal abuse. Nothing send your conscious thru a loop like these situations… are you now doing okay? Sounds like it, but this community has your back if you ever need it|Thanks for the kind words.  I mean, I\'m.. Here. I\'m financially secure, but I\'ll never be the same again.  I never really learned how to communicate with people, and after 14, I haven\'t had a friendship that lasted for more than two weeks. I never learned how to communicate things, and I would use manipulation to make them pity me, and stay until they realized what I was doing.  I\'m not a psychopath, though. I hated myself for what I was doing, and it made my depression/anxiety so much worse. At 16 I just, stopped making friends. If I could feel somebody trying to get closer to me, I would virtually run away and hide from them. I can\'t do that to another person.  Other than that, diagnosed with clinical depression at 9, severe anxiety at 12, and PTSD at 19. I may be developing ASPD as well, but that\'s internet diagnosis, and I\'m not going to go to another shrink, so let\'s just say I don\'t.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r5v9la/i_ran_away_from_an_abusive_home_and_became/hmqtmn0/)\nI had a very long stint where I was surviving on candy bars and working minumum wage while living in an abusive household. It\'s not the same, but I was living in random people\'s houses for years, and I can relate.  I\'m really proud of you for everything you\'ve done. I know how hard it can be to have *actual* nothing.  But what you do have - survival - is more than most people will ever know. It is invaluable.  Keep going.|Thank you for the kind words. When did your survival story start? When did it end? I\'d love to hear more about it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r5v9la/i_ran_away_from_an_abusive_home_and_became/hmr2dzm/)\nCongratulations on making it so far.

Have you moved cities since then?|My school was in a hick town called Midway. My McDonald\'s was on the outskirts of a city called Midway.  North Carolina, btw.  Also, no. Currently living in Midway, and working in Winston-Salem.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r5v9la/i_ran_away_from_an_abusive_home_and_became/hmqsbyu/)\nHow long were you without consistent shelter?|I was without consistent shelter the entire time I was homeless. I would say.. 9 months?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r5v9la/i_ran_away_from_an_abusive_home_and_became/hmqt8z9/)\nWhat are some tips out on the street you learned while being homeless|NEVER stay in one place for too long. Always keep moving. Only sit down/lay down when you\'re physically unable to keep moving. As a young kid, you have no place to call your own. No matter where you plop down at, another homeless person \'owns\' that spot, and they\'re not shy about telling you off.  Always make as many friends as you can. It\'s extremely hard to do with the homeless, because their lives have made them reclusive, paranoid and distrusting, but you can make a few friends, that are willing to share something with you, should you be close to death. I made two real friends during that time, and I would bring them food from the McDonald\'s that I worked at.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r5v9la/i_ran_away_from_an_abusive_home_and_became/hmqvdi1/)\nWhat would you like to do in the future?|Survive. :P  I was hoping to becoming an astronaut. I was well on my way to a full-ride scholarship at Duke University, before I dropped out in the 12th Grade to help take care of my nephew.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r5v9la/i_ran_away_from_an_abusive_home_and_became/hmr8no0/)\nDo you plan on having kids, what reasons for whatever response to the first part?|No, because I don\'t really want to bring any more kids into this world.  Even if I did, my girlfriend would have to be artificially inseminated. I\'m not okay with being touched.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r5v9la/i_ran_away_from_an_abusive_home_and_became/hmra6bj/)\nWhat kind of music have you been listening to lately?|I listen to Synthwave, Nightstop, Outrun, and Vaporwave.

It’s just where I started) Then at 14, I was introduced to liquor. I loved the warm care free feeling it gave me. It just snowballed from there. Graduated to pills, powder, etc. It was all an attempt to cover up past trauma, insecurities, emotions, etc. It’s been so long I’m almost not even sure what I was running from anymore. This will take some time to work through for sure. My rock bottom was leaving my job in handcuffs, getting my car and wallet stolen, jumped on the infamous 8 mile, and trying to figure out how I’m going to pay my rent. I felt extremely hopeless. I checked myself into a hospital and from there was sent to a psych ward. I sat with a social worker and we called 5 different inpatient rehabs and none would accept me because my insurance “wasn’t good enough” out of pocket it was about $1000 a day, which obviously wasn’t an option for me. I was discharged from the hospital and went back to my apartment. All my friends had given up on me and family would barely speak to me. I went on one last run and often contemplated suicide. I just woke up one day and said I couldn’t take it anymore. I was tired of being tired, emotionally and mentally exhausted.

In different states.\n\n1: Take your right to remain silent seriously. This literally means the court CAN NOT use your silence against you in a trial. This fucks so many people and they don\'t even know it. If you are a suspect in any police activity, think of your interaction with them like a game. If you decide to remain silent, even if you tell that to police, they will try anything they can to get you to talk, and it usually works because they are in a position of authority. If you remember that your interaction with them ends at the jail, you will be better off. Its scary to go to jail, but just because you go to jail DOES NOT mean you are convicted of anything. If you can keep your cool and remember that, you will win most cases with a good defense attorney.\n\nNote: Same thing goes with OWIs / or DUIs / or DWIs\n\n2: Be respectful when interacting with police. This may sound dumb, but its actually serious. Even if you don\'t agree with why you were pulled over, for all you know that officer just got finished dealing with a suicide of a 13 year old boy (true story). All I\'m saying is that you may not know what that cops state of mind is at any given time. I\'m not using that as an excuse for all police behavior, but it is real.\n\n3: All this being said, don\'t take online videos that claim they can teach you how to "get out of" dealings with cops seriously. If an officer is telling you to do something (I.E. a lawful order), 99.9% of the time, they are correct, have done their homework and are professionals. I\'m not telling you to do things that are obviously wrong, but don\'t argue with an officer because you think they might give up, or you have the upper hand.

Did all 15 strangers show up to dinner? Did you serve any wine? What was the age range?  Would  you have invited me? (70 yr. old single Male?)|Tinder is just a dating app where you swipe yes or no on people and they swipe yes or no on you until you both swipe yes and that’s a match. On my profile I told them that it was for thanksgiving and only really posted pics of food. I matched with a lot of people but 15 ended up coming. Everyone who came ended up being under 27, but I did have 4 50+ year olds who were supposed to come but canceled. You would have definitely invited if you were interested.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r51exr/i_22f_invited_15_strangers_from_tinder_to_have/hmk3sxj/)\nDid they all know that there would be other ppl from tinder there?|They did know, but some of them didn’t really understand so I had to be super clear about it|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r51exr/i_22f_invited_15_strangers_from_tinder_to_have/hmk1ey2/)\nDid you sleep with any of them / all of them?|Haha no, I don’t have sex. But I’m very good at making things platonic|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r51exr/i_22f_invited_15_strangers_from_tinder_to_have/hmk2p39/)\nWhy did you decide to do that? And how did people interact, was it only guys?|Well I’m vegan so I didn’t want to invite my friends and force them to eat vegan food so I put it in my profile and let prowl swipe if they were interested. I did have one guy bring a girl so that was nice! And people were pretty chill they stayed from like 4 to midnight|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r51exr/i_22f_invited_15_strangers_from_tinder_to_have/hmk8yr4/)\nAre you going to do it for Christmas to?|Haha probably not, I’ll be visiting my parents|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r51exr/i_22f_invited_15_strangers_from_tinder_to_have/hmk9ctq/)\nI bet it got weird at some point|I mean there were some lulls in conversation but i think overall it was fine|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r51exr/i_22f_invited_15_strangers_from_tinder_to_have/hmkfgyx/)\nThis sounds really cool. What kind of foods do you make for a vegan Thanksgiving?|I made most of the classics, mashed potatoes, stuffing, sweet potatoes, green bean casserole, Mac and cheese, seitan turkey, zucchini and squash, gravy, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie, pecan pie, and apple crumble|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r51exr/i_22f_invited_15_strangers_from_tinder_to_have/hmkh07b/)\nHave you watched too much yestheory?|I don’t know what that is|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r51exr/i_22f_invited_15_strangers_from_tinder_to_have/hmkecab/)\nThat's really sweet, but how on earth did you trust 15 guys from Tinder to come to your place? Hell I wouldn't even trust 1 before meeting in public first.|Haha well I figure if one of them are crazy then I still have 14 that aren’t crazy. I never really felt unsafe|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r51exr/i_22f_invited_15_strangers_from_tinder_to_have/hmknzkv/)\nHow did you all spend the time?|We played games and ate mostly and lots of just chatting|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r51exr/i_22f_invited_15_strangers_from_tinder_to_have/hmkbebe/)\nDid anyone who came think it would be an orgy when they arrived|I don’t think so|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r51exr/i_22f_invited_15_strangers_from_tinder_to_have/hmkj53w/)\ndid you connect with any of them enough to want to text them to hang out again?|Not really|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r51exr/i_22f_invited_15_strangers_from_tinder_to_have/hmkjuv7/)\n[deleted]|No I don’t think so|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r51exr/i_22f_invited_15_strangers_from_tinder_to_have/hmkk30w/)\nDid everyone invited get to stuff your turkey?|It was vegan so no turkeys were stuffed|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r51exr/i_22f_invited_15_strangers_from_tinder_to_have/hmki4vj/)\nAre you going to be nude|I’m never nude|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r51exr/i_22f_invited_15_strangers_from_tinder_to_have/hmkce10/)\n\n---\n[Source] (https://github.com/johnsliao/ama_compiler)"]], [['Plopgoestheweasle', 'I (22f) invited 15 strangers from tinder to have thanksgiving with me AMA\nI cooked all the food and it was a ton of fun!

Do Russians view him as an oppressive autocrat hungry for money and power like they do in the West or do they view him as a strong leader that helped pull the country out of the dark period it was in after the USSR collapse?

Putin put an end to a pointless war, where tens of thousands of teen conscripts died needlessly.

What\'s really happening is that as the body heats up, the water in the body (among other things) expands. If an arm or a leg is pointing in a somewhat downward direction, it can appear that a body is "sitting up".   Pets, when their legs extend, and been known to "roll over" as well.  Edit: added about the pets|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r55czh/i_cremate_people_and_pets_for_a_living_ama/hml6pt7/)\nCan I get cremated WITH my pet?|Not the way that you\'re thinking. By law, a human machine and a pet machine must be in separate rooms. Only human bodies can go in a human machine. However, your pet can be cremated in a pet machine, and then those ashes can be placed in with you when you are cremated. The only other way is to both be cremated separately and have your ashes mixed together.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r55czh/i_cremate_people_and_pets_for_a_living_ama/hmljv9a/)\nIs there actually a point where the body is perfectly cooked?|We are technically meat, so yes.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r55czh/i_cremate_people_and_pets_for_a_living_ama/hmlkdf6/)\nAre their ever dental fillings metal prosthetics or missed jewelry left over in the ashes?|Always. We have to remove all metal after cremation and before processing. At our company, any metal that\'s found is recycled and 100% of the money we get from it we donate to a foundation that helps children pay for funeral expenses when they lose their parents.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r55czh/i_cremate_people_and_pets_for_a_living_ama/hmlozwy/)\nDon\'t the ashes of the last bodies in the chamber mix with the latest one so that families actually receive mixed ashes?|There is no way to 100% clean out a machine, even when using an ash vacuum. So the answer is technically yes. However, the amount of mix is waaay less than 1%. You are still receiving as close to 100% of your loved one as possible, there\'s just no way to get everything from the cracks in the walls, floors and inaccessible chambers.  Edit: spelling|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r55czh/i_cremate_people_and_pets_for_a_living_ama/hmksrf4/)\nHow much fuel does it take to cremate an average adult?|Not sure. We don\'t keep track of fuel usage, the gas company does, buy seeing as I\'m not the owner, I don\'t get to see it. I can tell you that it takes anywhere from 90 minutes to a few hours to cremate an average adult. It all depends on fat vs muscle, weight, what type of container they\'re in and what # of the day they are.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r55czh/i_cremate_people_and_pets_for_a_living_ama/hmkzd4u/)\nHow many nights a week do you have \'mystery meat\' for dinner?|Lol, I always know what I\'m eating. Though I will skip meat on particularly bad days|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r55czh/i_cremate_people_and_pets_for_a_living_ama/hmld652/)\nHi! This is fascinating. Is it true that breast implants explode?|Thank you! And no, that is false. They may break, melt or "rupture", but explode is not a term I\'d use for it. The only things that explode are batteries, especially pacemakers. They are supposed to be removed by funeral directors BEFORE being brought to us, but a couple of things can happen. First, a pacemaker is supposed to be located in the chest, just below the collarbone. Most typically it\'s placed on the left side, but sometimes it has to be placed elsewhere due to medical reasons (right side of chest below the collarbone, or even down by the hip). If a person isn\'t thoroughly checked, it can be missed. Another reason it can be missed is the family members who meet with the funeral directors may not even know their loved one got a pacemaker in the first place. And finally, there are new pacemakers placed directly on the heart. These can only be removed by an autopsy.  Pacemakers explode. It sounds like a bomb going off or even a shotgun being shot next to you. They can cause damage to the machines and has even killed crematory operators before.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/r55czh/i_cremate_people_and_pets_for_a_living_ama/hmlzvjm/)\n\n---\n[Source] (https://github.com/johnsliao/ama_compiler)'], ['MrMeow8', 'Good bot']], [['MrMeow8', 'I cremate people and pets for a living.
